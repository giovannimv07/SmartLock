# SmartLock
A lock that takes 4 digital numbers as the code to unlock it. The smart lock will log the date and time of the event and send it to the database to be store. The device will have an application that will have access to locking/unlocking the smart lock and see the log events recorded. The log events will show when it was unlocked, and locked.
